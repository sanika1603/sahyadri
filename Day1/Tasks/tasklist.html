        <p><b>Early Life and Education</b><br>
            Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab (now in Pakistan), into a Sikh family deeply involved in the struggle for Indian independence. His father, Kishan Singh, and his uncle, Ajit Singh, were actively engaged in revolutionary activities, which influenced Bhagat Singh from an early age. He was educated at the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic High School in Lahore, where he was exposed to nationalist ideas and the works of revolutionaries like Lala Lajpat Rai.
            <br><br><b>Inspiration and Early Involvement in Freedom Struggle</b><br> 
            As a young man, Bhagat Singh was profoundly moved by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 and the subsequent Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. However, when Gandhi called off the movement after the Chauri Chaura incident in 1922, Bhagat Singh became disillusioned with non-violent methods. He sought out more radical solutions, joining the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), a revolutionary organization committed to overthrowing British rule through armed resistance.
            <br><br><b>Formation of Naujawan Bharat Sabha and Ideological Evolution</b> <br> 
            In 1926, Bhagat Singh co-founded the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, a youth organization aimed at spreading socialist ideals and rallying young Indians to fight against British colonialism. His time in the HRA also deepened his understanding of Marxist and socialist ideologies, and he began advocating for a revolution that would not only free India from British rule but also end the exploitation of the working class.
            <br><br><b>Key Revolutionary Acts</b> <br>
            One of Bhagat Singh's most notable acts of defiance came in 1928, when he, along with Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev Thapar, plotted the assassination of James A. Scott, a British police officer responsible for the lathi charge that led to the death of nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai. However, they mistakenly killed John Saunders, a police officer, instead. Following this incident, Bhagat Singh went into hiding but remained active in revolutionary circles.
            In 1929, Bhagat Singh and his comrade Batukeshwar Dutt carried out a symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi, throwing bombs in the chamber while shouting slogans of revolution. They ensured that no one was harmed, as their aim was to make a political statement. After the bombing, they voluntarily surrendered, knowing that their trial would give them a platform to spread their message.
           <br> <br><b>Trial, Imprisonment, and Legacy</b> <br>
            Bhagat Singh's trial for the Assembly bombing and the Saunders' murder attracted widespread attention. During the trial, Bhagat Singh used the courtroom as a stage to deliver his revolutionary ideals. His hunger strike in jail demanding equal rights for Indian political prisoners further galvanized public support.
            On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were executed by the British authorities. Though only 23 years old at the time of his death, Bhagat Singh became an enduring symbol of resistance against colonial oppression and an inspiration for future generations of Indians.
           <br> <br><b>Legacy </b><br>
            Bhagat Singhâ€™s legacy transcends his life, as he became one of India's most revered martyrs. His ideas of secularism, socialism, and revolution continue to inspire people. He remains a national hero whose life and death continue to be commemorated in India every year on Shaheed Diwas (Martyrs' Day) on March 23.</br>
